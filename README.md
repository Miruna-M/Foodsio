# Foodsio
This is a food recipe finder application that can be used on both a PC screen and a mobile device in order to make it more easily accessible. To find recipe ideas, the user just has to search for the ingredient they intend on using, and the website will load up a number of recipes using that ingredient. This website is useful because when someone has an ingredient they want to use, they can just type the ingredient into the search bar and see all the foods they can make, complete with a scroll bar. 

The website uses the Recipe Search API from: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api

When the user hovers their mouse over a food card, the website will show the recipe, and the user can scroll down inside the food card to see the full recipe.

PC Version, using Search: "fish" as an example:

The website can also be resized to a Mobile Version:
